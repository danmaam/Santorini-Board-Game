Progetto di Ing Sw A.A. 2019/2020

Our project has been developed by Daniele Mammone, Rebecca Marelli and Annalaura Massa.

We chose to implement the following functionalities:
-complete rules, with the possibility to play both with and without the god cards and with 2 or 3 players;
-CLI;
-GUI;
-socket for the network part;
-two advanced functionalities.
The two advanced functionalities we chose are:
-possibility to play with 5 advanced gods, in addition to the basic ones. The gods we decided to implement are Chronus, Circe, Eros, Hestia and Zeus.
-multiple matches handled by the server at the same time.

 There is only one jar to start the server, CLI or GUI parts of the game, depending on different parameters.
 The commands are the following:
 -"java --jar santorinigame.jar --startserver" to start the server;
 -"java --jar santorinigame.jar --cli" to start the client in CLI mode;
 -"java --jar santorinigame.jar" to start the client in GUI mode;
